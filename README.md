# Sudoku-Solver

## Project Overview

This is a graphical Sudoku solver implemented using Python's Tkinter library for the GUI. The solver allows users to input Sudoku puzzles and attempts to solve them using a backtracking algorithm. If the puzzle is solvable, the solution is displayed on the grid. If it cannot be solved, an error message will be shown.

## Repository Structure

- sudoku_solver.py
The repository consists of a single Python file, `sudoku_solver.py`, which contains the GUI code and the Sudoku-solving logic.

## How to Use

1. **Input the Sudoku Puzzle:** Enter numbers into the grid. Leave empty cells blank for unsolved parts of the puzzle.
2. **Solve the Puzzle:** Click the "Solve" button to attempt solving the puzzle. The solution will be displayed if it exists.
3. **Clear the Puzzle:** Use the "Clear" button to reset the grid for a new puzzle.

## Clone Repo

To clone the repository, use the following command:
```bash
